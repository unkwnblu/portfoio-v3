    bio: "I'm a multi-disciplinary creative based in Nigeria—part designer, part developer, full-time problem solver. As a student and professional freelancer, I bridge the gap between beautiful interfaces and robust engineering. When I'm not pushing pixels or writing code, you'll find me behind a camera lens, binge-watching anime, or editing my latest video project.",
